# StitchMan

## Introduction
An iPad application for image stitching, featuring the following technologies:
* SIFT algorithm (scale-invariant feature transform) for key points detection.
* RANSAC algorithm (random sample consensus) for key points matching.
* Image stitching.

## Disclaimer
This application was built in 2013 and it's for educational purposes only. It's not meant to run in any production environment since no optimization was ever made and the program is extremely slow.

## Build
Simply open the project with Xcode and build. It should work on any iPad device/simulator. iPhone is not supported.
